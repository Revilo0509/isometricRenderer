# Revilo0509s Isometric Renderer

This is mostly just a tech-demo I made just to see what how and if, I could make an isometric world. so here it is.

## Building
It uses the standard raylib build template, So there is additional building info [here](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib)
I use VScode so when you have cloned the repo, You can just press F5 and it will build and start.
