# Revilo0509s Isometric Renderer

This is mostly just a tech-demo I made just to see what how and if, I could make an isometric world. so here it is.

## Building
Have an c++ compiler and cmake installed and use cmake to build. Incase you already have raylib accessible trough find_package() it will use you local install, otherwise it will fetch it from github.
